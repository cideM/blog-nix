# README

This project is built with `nix`. The recommended setup for development is a combination of `direnv` and `lorri`. With this, there's nothing for you to do except open this directory and wait until `lorri` is done building everything in `nix-shell`.

## Scripts

- `$ ./scripts/watch.sh` starts a file watcher which will rebuild the project and then serve the built files in `/public`
- `$ ./scripts/dev.sh` called by `watch.sh` and runs the build process (build with go, copy styles.css, serve with miniserve)

## Nix

- `shell.nix` sets up the development environment
- `blog.nix` is for building the blog
- `node-env.nix`, `node-packages.nix` and `netlify.nix` are generated by `node2nix` and do *download the 21040298 dependencies of netlify-cli*.

## Deploy

`netlify deploy -d result/public` followed by `netlify deploy -d result/public --prod` if good
